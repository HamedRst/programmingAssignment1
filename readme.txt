This it a tool made by Hamed Rastaghi that takes the circuit using Boolean function or AIG graph and has 12 commands:1. Return the design as a canonical SOP2. Return the design as a canonical POS3. Return the design INVERSE as a canonical SOP4. Return the design INVERSE as a canonical POS5. Return a minimized number of literals representation in SOP6. Return a minimized number of literals representation in POS7. Report the number of Prime Implicants8. Report the number of Essential Prime Implicants9. Report the number of ON-Set minterms10. Report the number of ON-Set maxterms11. number of inputs that affect output:  12.get expression using Essential PrimeTo exit you should enter 13.To input a function using AIG graph you should enter each node operation and node inputs separately.
